Oregon idiot leadership made it know that they could appeal and sue using taxpayers money if it  took everything the state had. They go on to explain how our governor and his buddies kept making changes and adding bells and whistles. Even when told by experts it would not work  Oregon insisted on the changes then blamed it on Oracle. If you look around you will find Oracle products running the most comprehensive programs available. Oracle management decided that to take on Oregon was like trying to sue a dictator who is always right and will sacrifice anything to make them right. Doesn't Oregon still owe about 120 million on this? Maybe mz brown will apply their big wind fall to the billion and a half health care shortage. Or the interest paid on loans to pay for pers. But I expect to see some pay increases and bonuses paid to the people who caused the problem. Oregon's so called leadership. Taxpayers lose big time.\n",
